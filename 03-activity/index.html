Indulge in the extraordinary flavors of Fariñas Lechon - where "Crispy, Juicy, and Flavorful" come together in perfect harmony. Embark on a culinary journey as we present the renowned roasted pig delicacy, beloved across the Philippines.

Imagine a succulent masterpiece crowned with impeccably crispy skin, a delight that needs no accompaniment, as the tender, flavorful meat is lovingly marinated with an exquisite blend of organic ingredients. Our offering comes in two delectable variations: the timeless original and the tantalizing spicy option.

At Fariñas Lechon, we invite you to relish an ambiance that exudes a sense of 'home,' an amalgamation of contemporary and classic designs reminiscent of "Old Cebu with a twist." To further enhance your experience, we've established a Lechon Fulfillment Center, catering to whole lechon orders, along with a convenient takeaway counter for your pasalubong needs.

      <p>
        Why is there a difference of LECHON Prices between Manila and Cebu? <br>
        <em> The cost of supplies and ingredients in Cebu is cheaper than in Manila, thus considering these factors, lechon prices differ as well.

      <p>
        Can I still order Lechon coming from Cebu even if you have branches here in Manila?  <br>
